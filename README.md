# slicer
this is a smaller commit, a single class that tries to emulate the slicing and modification capabilities of numpy's array from scratch<br><br>

this was purely made for fun and out of curiosity<br><br>

Hopefully, will be trying to use this to extend into a custom pandas.DataFrame remake shortly!
